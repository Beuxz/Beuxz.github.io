# Borderlands 2 Minecraft Map

A detailed, full-scale recreation of Borderlands 2 in Minecraft. Explore, download, and experience Pandora like never before!

## About the Project
I started this project because I couldn’t find a full Borderlands 2 map in Minecraft, so I decided to make one myself. Having played BL2 for years, I wanted to bring the world of Pandora into Minecraft with attention to detail, scale, and the iconic art style.

The map is being built following the main story progression, which helps keep the areas consistent and logical for players exploring them.

## Building Process
- **Time to complete a location:** A few days to a few weeks (working solo).  
- **Tools used:** A mix of **WorldEdit** for terraforming and bulk placement, and **hand-building** for finer details (~50/50).  
- **Art style:** I use **Sildur’s Shaders** to achieve a cel-shaded, Borderlands-like look in Minecraft.

## Future Plans
- I’m confident I’ll complete the full map, though it may take a year given the scale of the project.  
- When finished, I plan to release a folder with **commands for NPCs and enemies** to enhance gameplay.  
- I am **not planning to host a public server**, but you can use the map in your own worlds.
